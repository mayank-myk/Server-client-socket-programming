# Server-client-socket-programming
Using socket programming to implement a simple client and server that communicate over the network and implement a simple application involving Cash Registers. The client implements a simple cash register that opens a session with the server and then supplies a sequence of codes (refer request-response messages format) for some products. The server returns the price of each one, if the product is available, and also keeps a running total of purchases for each clients transactions. When the client closes the
session, the server returns the total cost. using a TXT file as a database to store the UPC code and item description at the server end.

Using signal handl so that when the server is terminated by pressing control C, it gracefully release the open socket
